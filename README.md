# double_crossed_words_C
Using memory manipulation to make a fragment of crossword.

Firstly we have to enter four words and then magic happens itself (arrow is a new line):
```

    B⏎
    E⏎
    H⏎
    A⏎
    V⏎
MULTIPLE⏎
    O⏎

               I⏎
               L⏎
               Y⏎

As a result we get double crossed words which looks like a fragment of crossword.
